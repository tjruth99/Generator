# Overview
This document outlines the design and purpose of my Generator Website. The purpose of this website is to be a simple to use random generator for use in creative projects. As a musician, I sometimes find it hard to come with ideas for melodies or chord changes and wish there was some way to come up with ideas easily. A random generator can be a powerful tool for sparking creativity. 

I wish to design a website that others and myself can use to generate many different types of ideas such as color palates, chord progressions, and writing prompts. On top of this functionality, I also want to include more trivial generators such as random number generators, color generators, name generators, and also to add functionality for lists such as choosing a random element from a list and randomly sorting a list of elements.

# Goals

### Main Goals

 - Random generators for numbers, colors and sequences
	 - Have default options for DnD dice rolls (d4, d8, d20, etc)
- List functionality
	- Choose a random element from an imputed list
	- Randomly sort elements from a list 
 - Scalability, should be able to easily add new generators later
 - Deployed and publicly available

### Advanced Goals
- Word generator
	- Writing prompt generator
	- Paragraph randomize
- Topological map generation
	- Random Walk
	- Perlin Noise
	- Research other methods
- Dungeon map generator
- Music generators
	- Chord progression within a Key
	- Random scale for practicing
	- Choose a random Jazz standard from a Real Book
- Add animations
	- Such as a spinning wheel while generating
	
# Technology
I plan to use React as the main framework for the website with Bootstrap for CSS styling.

I plan on using a back-end framework such as Flask.

Ideally I want to be able to host somewhere for free such as GitHub pages.
